## Reflections

Working with Chrome DevTools was really helpful to identify problematic areas throughout the website especially in CSS. I appreciated how I was able to add styles without completely overriding the main code. Chrome DevTools is definitely a powerfool tool to experiment on styling and layout.

Adhering to the provided design specs taught me the significance of paying attention to even the smallest design details. Proper font choices, color combinations, and spacing are crucial for creating a professional-looking website. This project is a great training for me as a developer because  in real-world scenarios, developers are often presented with designs crafted by UI/UX designers, who meticulously research and cater to user-centered needs. 

Completing this project enabled me to accurately translate designs into code. This close alignment between the design and implementation ensures that the final product aligns perfectly with the designer's vision, fostering effective collaboration.
